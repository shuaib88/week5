MPCS 50101: Homework for Week 5
===============================

There is just one challenge this week.

### Coin Dispenser

Open the `coin_dispenser.py` file.

Your job is to make the code run as is, without any errors, and **without changing the code**.  (However, you *are* allowed to add *additional files* into the same folder).

If you're successful, you should see the following when you run the program:

```
Congratulations!  All assertions passed!
```

There are hints at the bottom of the coin_dispenser.py file.

Good luck and have fun!  Post a message to Piazza if you have any questions.
